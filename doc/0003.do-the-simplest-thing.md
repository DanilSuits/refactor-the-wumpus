As opportunities for improvement go, this code is a target
rich environment.  There is so much going on that needs
to be improved, it's hard to guess where to start; it's
hard to see manageable chunks.

The most important thing is to _try something_.  Almost
any change you want to make to the code is going to be
an improvement.
