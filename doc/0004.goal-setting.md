If you are having trouble finding a focus, think about
a new feature to add to the program, and concentrate
your attention on making that feature easy.

Some possibilities:

* Support for languages other than English
* Porting to a more fully featured [interactive shell][1]
* Changing the size of the maze
* Changing the tunnels per room
* Removing arbitrary tunnels from the maze
* Adding more hazards
* Adding _new_ hazards
* Supporting sharable seeds
* Supporting a web UI.
