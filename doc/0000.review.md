# Code Review

- The existing logic mixes I/O and presentation with the core logic.
- The presence of the I/O and Random inputs makes the code non deterministic
- The existing code runs in a never ending loop; there is no way from the outside
to pause the execution and query what is going on.
- The code depends on widely scoped variables, there is some spooky action at
a distance.
